Go Fish is a fun card game that uses a standard 52 card deck. It can be played
with 2 people or more. 

Game Rules 

Starting the Game 

The first thing you do is deal cards to the players. For 2 to 3 players you
deal each player 7 cards. If there are more than three players, deal 5 cards
each. The rest of the deck is then spread out in the middle of the players face
down. This can be called the pool of cards. 

Taking a Turn 

Each player gets a turn in clockwise order (to the player's left). 

During a turn the player asks another player if they have a particular rank of
card. For example, the player may ask Kathy if she has any nines. If Kathy has
any nines, then she must give all of her nines to the player. If Kathy doesn't
have any nines, then she says "go fish". 

When you "go fish" you can take any card from the pool. 

If the player gets the cards they asked for, either from the pool or from
Kathy, then the player gets another turn. 

If the player gets all four suits of the same rank, then they can put the cards
face up in front of them. For example, if you already had a nine of hearts,
clubs, and spades; then you picked up the nine of diamonds from the pool, you
then get to place the set of nine cards down in front of you and you get
another turn. 

Winning the Game 

Go Fish is over when one player runs out of cards or there are no more cards in
the pool. The winner is then determined by who has the most piles or suits of
cards in front of them.
